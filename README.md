Our code comprises the following:

2.Calculator java file
3.extra_credit txt file
4.infix_expr_short txt file
5.myResults output file
6.tests java file
7. OUTPUT from the command line
8. postfix_eval_short

The labs package comprises our stack and queue data structures used to implement the shunting yard alrgorithm.
The Calculator class which contains all the code (converting to 
postfix, postfix evaluation).

Kindly run the code on the command-line, with the first argument being the input txt 
file(either "infix_expr_short" or "extra_credit",
and the second one being the name of your output file.
you can also run the test java file in eclipse to print on the console.

The following are our avenues for extra credit:

Implementation of modulo and exponential functions
Astute handling of invalid inputs
